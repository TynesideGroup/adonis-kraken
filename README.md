:exclamation: **WARNING! This package is heavily in development and is therefore unstable. It may not work correctly or at all. When it is working the way that it needs to I will bump it up to 0.1.0!**

## Installation
* Run `adonis install adonis-kraken` within your Adonis project
* Add `'adonis-kraken/providers/KrakenProvider'` to the `providers` array within `start/app.js`

## Configuration
Configuration is done through `config/kraken.js`. This file should have automatically been copied to your project during installation if you installed it via adonis-cli. If you installed it with npm or Yarn, or the file was not copied across correctly, you can manually copy the [config file](config/kraken.js) from this package or run the following command to create it:
```bash
adonis kraken:getconfig
```
